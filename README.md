# Terraform Practice Project

This project contains practice files to learn how to create and manage infrastructure using Terraform and shell scripting.

## Included files

- `main.tf` — Terraform configuration file for AWS infrastructure.
- `sample.sh` — Sample shell script for automation or setup.

## .gitignore Explanation

This project’s `.gitignore` is configured to:

- Ignore all files **except** `.tf`, `.sh`, and `.md` files.
- Ignore the `.terraform/` directory (Terraform cache and state files).

This keeps the repository clean and tracks only the important code and documentation files.
